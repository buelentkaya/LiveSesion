#JAVA OOP Concepts ##Encapsulation ###What is Encapsulation?

Data Hiding
Hiding the data by providing private access modifiers
How do we perform? (PIQ)
make all class fields private
create public getter: to read the data
create public setter: to write the data
Encapsulation helps us to manipulate the data field with certain
conditions(we will apply this concept with Singleton Driver Class Design)
